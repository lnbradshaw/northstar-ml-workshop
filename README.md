# northstar-ml-workshop

This workshop is heavily inspired by Dr. Andrew Ng's course on Deep Learning. You can find the entirety of his course on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS4cs9xVecg&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?utm_source=deeplearningai&utm_medium=institutions&utm).

3Blue1Brown also has a fantastic series of [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) about machine learning.
